## Task3 Statistic:

You are trying to prove that when a customer spends above a certain threshold and selects express shipping, he is probably a fraud. You compare two groups—fraudsters vs. honest customers—and notice that indeed the former group spends more on average. What do you have to check before you can say with confidence that high spend is a likely sign of fraud?

## Answer.
There are dedicated statistic and machine learning technique to help with avoiding fraud transactions.
1. First I would compare all data transactions available for both groups and will search for patterns and regularity in both the groups (groups—fraudsters vs. honest customers—and)
2. Comparing data points such as email address, a phone number, their IP address, geolocation and shipping address is very good idea.
3. Checking for a social footprint. Failing to confirm the cardholder’s identity using public data from social media.
4. Identifying card testing attempts: For most online stores, transaction fraud will appear as low-value transactions that fraudsters use to see if the card can work.
5. Understanding how users connect to your site can help point to risk. For instance, customers using VPNs, proxies or emulators are very likely trying to spoof data.

 **We need high probability about 95% to comfortably address that specific transaction is a fraud.**
