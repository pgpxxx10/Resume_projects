### Hi! My name is Piotr. I'm a Data Scientist.

Data Science and solving business problems are my passions. 
My name is **Piotr Gudro Puischel (PGP)** I started my fascination with numbers at school during economy study. I work for industries like cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, aviation. During my carrier I have held positions strongly involved with working on data. 

Recently I transitioned into data science from a business. When I was first starting out on my data science journey I decided to self study and learn using my statistic background and focus on gaining experience in working on data using python and SQL
